# iBeacon-probe

Code result from the appsterdam workshop on iBeacon. This challange was to get it working on Android devices.

Thhis small app shows how the device is positioned between two iBeacons (closer to one or another).

The position jumps about a bit and that could be overcome with some filtering (it's how the data reaches the app).
